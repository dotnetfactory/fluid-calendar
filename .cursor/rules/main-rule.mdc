- this is a locally running web app with 1 user and no authenitaction is needed
- this app will be a clone of the Motion app for calendar and task management
- user can add a google calendar, by clicking add calendar, get the google auth screen, authorizes the app full access to the calendar
- then i should get redirected to the app with my google calendars showing in the sidebar and created in the database.
- we also support outlook and caldav
- since this is a local app, we will be using postgres
- this app is built with nextjs, tailwind, prisma, sqltie, shadcn
- it uses fullcalendar package
- when adding an external calendar like google or outlook, we still need to sync the data in our database so we are always working with our local data
- the google auth needs to handle refreshing tokens so when the token expires an hour later, we can get a new one and continue syncing.
- use shadcn whenever possible, the correct command to use is `npx shadcn@latest add`
- make minimal changes and don't change or break existing logic and only apply the changes requested.
