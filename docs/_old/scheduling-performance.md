# Scheduling Performance Optimization

## Current Issues
The auto-scheduling process for tasks has improved from ~59 seconds to ~1.26 seconds for 46 tasks (97.9% improvement). This document outlines the remaining optimizations and next steps.

### Performance Bottlenecks

1. **Sequential Task Scheduling**
   - Tasks still scheduled one at a time
   - Some potential for parallel scheduling of non-overlapping tasks
   - Room for smarter time window selection

2. **Database Operations**
   - Individual task updates
   - Potential for batch operations
   - Transaction overhead

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: ✅ Calendar Event Caching
- [x] Implement week-based calendar event caching
- [x] Add cache validation and logging
- [x] Extend cache TTL to 30 minutes
- [x] Add debug logging for cache hits/misses
- Results: Reduced total time from 59s to 10.88s (81.6% improvement)

### Phase 2: ✅ Batch Conflict Processing
- [x] Implement batch calendar event fetching
- [x] Add batch conflict checking
- [x] Optimize cache utilization
- [x] Reduce database queries
- Results: Further reduced time to 1.26s (88.4% additional improvement)
  - Scoring phase: 0.52s (41.3%)
  - Scheduling phase: 0.74s (58.5%)
  - Individual task scheduling: ~0.02s (down from ~0.15s)

### Phase 3: Smart Window Selection
- [ ] Pre-analyze time windows for congestion
- [ ] Skip obviously congested periods
- [ ] Prioritize optimal time slots
- [ ] Add congestion metrics
- [ ] Expected Impact: 20% reduction in both phases

### Phase 4: Parallel Task Scheduling
- [ ] Implement parallel scheduling for non-overlapping tasks
- [ ] Add scheduling groups
- [ ] Implement conflict prevention
- [ ] Add concurrency controls
- [ ] Expected Impact: 30-40% reduction in scheduling phase

### Phase 5: Batch Database Operations
- [ ] Group task updates
- [ ] Implement transaction batching
- [ ] Optimize commit timing
- [ ] Add failure recovery
- [ ] Expected Impact: 10-15% reduction in scheduling phase

## Next Steps
Priority for next implementation should be Phase 3: Smart Window Selection because:
1. Safest optimization with no concurrency concerns
2. Benefits both scoring and scheduling phases
3. Builds on existing caching improvements
4. Makes future parallel scheduling more effective
5. Relatively straightforward to implement

## Current Results
- Initial: ~59 seconds for 46 tasks
- After Phase 1: ~10.88 seconds (81.6% improvement)
- After Phase 2: ~1.26 seconds (97.9% total improvement)
  - Scoring phase: 0.52s (41.3%)
  - Scheduling phase: 0.74s (58.5%)
  - Average task scoring: 0.04-0.09s
  - Average task scheduling: ~0.02s

## Expected Results
- Current: ~1.26 seconds for 46 tasks
- Expected After Phase 3: ~1.00 seconds
- Expected After Phase 4: ~0.70 seconds
- Expected After Phase 5: ~0.60 seconds

## Testing Requirements
- [x] Benchmark tests for Phase 1
- [x] Benchmark tests for Phase 2
- [ ] Window congestion analysis
- [ ] Parallel scheduling stress tests
- [ ] Database batch operation tests

## Monitoring
- [x] Performance metrics logging
- [x] Operation timing breakdown
- [x] Cache hit/miss tracking
- [ ] Window congestion metrics
- [ ] Database operation metrics

## Future Considerations
- Machine learning for optimal scheduling
- Real-time schedule adjustments
- Distributed scheduling for large workloads
- User preference learning
