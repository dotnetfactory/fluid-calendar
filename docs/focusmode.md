# Focus Mode Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding a Focus Mode feature to FluidCalendar. The feature will leverage the existing auto-scheduling system to help users focus on their most important tasks.

## Core Features

### 1. Focus Mode UI ✅
- Full-screen overlay with navbar retained
- Minimalist design with reduced visual noise
- Smooth transitions between states
- Quick action buttons for task management

### 2. Task Selection ✅
Leverage existing auto-scheduling system to:
- Select top 3 tasks based on:
  * Schedule score (already implemented)
  * Due dates
  * Priority levels
  * Energy levels
  * Project grouping
- Show why each task was selected
- Allow manual override of selection

### 3. Task Focus View ✅
- Enlarged current task view
- Dimmed secondary tasks
- Progress tracking
- Quick actions:
  * Mark as complete
  * Move to next task
  * Add notes
  * Add subtasks
  * Pause/resume
  * Exit focus mode

### 4. State Management ✅
- Track focus mode state
- Persist focus session data
- Handle interruptions
- Save session statistics

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Focus Mode ⚡️ ✅
- [x] Add FocusMode type definitions
  ```typescript
  interface FocusMode {
    isActive: boolean;
    currentTaskId: string | null;
    queuedTaskIds: string[];
    sessionStartTime: Date | null;
    sessionStats: FocusSessionStats;
  }

  interface FocusSessionStats {
    tasksCompleted: number;
    timeSpent: number;
    sessionStart: Date;
    sessionEnd: Date | null;
  }
  ```

- [x] Create focus mode store
  * State management for focus mode
  * Actions for state changes
  * Session tracking

- [x] Implement focus mode component
  * Full-screen overlay
  * Task display
  * Basic controls

### Phase 2: Task Management 📋 ✅
- [x] Integrate with auto-scheduling
  * Reuse existing scoring system
  * Add focus-specific scoring factors
  * Task queue management

- [x] Add task transition logic
  * Complete current task
  * Move to next task
  * Update task status

- [x] Implement quick actions
  * Task completion
  * Task switching
  * Note taking
  * Subtask management

### Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancement 🎨 (In Progress)
- [x] Design and implement transitions
  * Smooth state changes
  * Task switching animations
  * Progress indicators

- [x] Add visual feedback
  * Task completion celebration (using canvas-confetti)
  * Progress visualization
  * Time tracking display

- [ ] Enhance accessibility
  * Keyboard shortcuts (in progress)
  * Screen reader support
  * High contrast mode

### Phase 4: Analytics & Insights 📊 (Planned)
- [ ] Track focus sessions
  * Time spent
  * Tasks completed
  * Break patterns

- [ ] Generate insights
  * Productivity patterns
  * Task completion rates
  * Focus session effectiveness

## Technical Details

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Core Components
- FocusMode
  |- FocusHeader
  |- TaskQueue
  |  |- QueuedTask (x3)

```typescript
// Focus Mode Store
interface FocusModeStore {
  // State
  currentTaskId: string | null;
  isProcessing: boolean;
  actionType: ActionType | null;
  actionMessage: string | null;

  // Actions
  startProcessing: (actionType: ActionType, message?: string) => void;
  stopProcessing: () => void;
  getCurrentTask: () => Task | null;
  getQueuedTasks: () => Task[];
  getQueuedTaskIds: () => string[];
  completeCurrentTask: () => void;
  postponeTask: (duration: string) => void;
}
```
