## Installation

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

1. Install Docker on your machine
2. Clone the repository (or just download the docker-compose.yml file):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dotnetfactory/fluid-calendar.git
   cd fluid-calendar
   ```

3. Copy the example environment file and configure it:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file and set at minimum these values:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://fluid:fluid@db:5432/fluid_calendar
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-key
   ```
   
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Visit http://localhost:3000

That's it! The application will be running with a PostgreSQL database automatically configured. The docker-compose.yml file is already configured to use the pre-built Docker image.

### For Developers

If you want to develop FluidCalendar:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dotnetfactory/fluid-calendar.git
   cd fluid-calendar
   ```

2. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

3. Visit http://localhost:3000

The development environment includes:
- Hot reloading
- PostgreSQL database
- Development tools
- Exposed database port (5432) for direct access

### Useful Docker Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker compose down

# Update to the latest version
docker pull eibrahim/fluid-calendar:latest
docker compose up -d

# Reset database (caution: deletes all data)
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d

# Access database CLI
docker compose exec db psql -U fluid -d fluid_calendar
```

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the following environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your application URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Random string for session encryption


Note: Google credentials and logging settings can be managed through the UI in Settings > System. Environment variables will be used as fallback if system settings are not configured.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dotnetfactory/fluid-calendar-saas.git
   ```

2. Enable SAAS features in your environment:
   ```
   # .env.local
   ENABLE_SAAS_FEATURES=true
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Syncing Changes Between Repositories

To sync changes from the private SAAS repository to the public open source repository:

1. Use the provided sync script:
   ```
   ./scripts/sync-repos.sh /path/to/private/repo /path/to/public/repo
   ```

2. Review the changes in the public repository
3. Commit and push the changes to the public repository

### Contributing to SAAS Features

When developing SAAS features:

1. Place all SAAS-specific code in the `src/saas` directory
2. Use the feature flag system to conditionally enable SAAS features
3. Provide fallbacks for SAAS features in the open source version

For more information about contributing to the SAAS version, please contact the maintainers.
