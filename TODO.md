# FluidCalendar Implementation Plan

## Next Steps
- [ ] Integrate google calendar
  - [ ] auto sync with webhooks
  - [ ] when deleting one event from the series, it deletes all instances locally but google is working fine.
- [ ] prevent adding events to read-only calendars
- [ ] allow changing calendar color
- [ ] allow calendar re-ordering in the UI
- [ ] when deleting a recurring event, it deletes all instances but it shows a random instance which disappears after a sync, also i tried it again and it only deleted the instance locally but the entire series deleted from google.
- [ ] add ability to RSVP
- [ ] show events not RSVPed to
- [ ] show spinner when deleting/creating/updating in event modal
- [ ] Use AI to break down tasks
- [ ] recurring tasks don't indicate that it's recurring
- [ ] Ability to add tasks in calendar view

## Outlook sync issues
- [ ] deleting one instance doesn't sync correctly
- [ ] add real-time updates with webhooks
- [ ] implement offline support

## Tasks
- [ ] task dependencies
- [ ] reschedule tasks after calendars to consider are changed
- [x] confidence scoring for auto-scheduled tasks
- [x] improved time slot selection algorithm

## 3. Drag and Drop Features
- [ ] Task Rescheduling
  - [ ] Enable drag and drop between time slots

## 5. Data Persistence
- [ ] Local Storage
  - [ ] Save tasks to localStorage
